# Task 1

## [](https://github.com/LavishSwarnkar/NAAD2/tree/master/src/com/streamliners/task1#11-modify)1.1 modify()

Write a function `String modify(String s, String replacements)`where :

- String s consists of digits (0-9).
- String replacements consists pairs of < int, char >.

Your task is to form a new string such that each digit in s is replaced by its corresponding character as given in replacements string.

Example :

`modify("12332321", "2R3S1T4D") = "TRSSRSRT"`

## [](https://github.com/LavishSwarnkar/NAAD2/tree/master/src/com/streamliners/task1#12-totalweight)1.2 totalWeight()

Write a function `int totalWeight(String s, int[] weights)`where :

- String s consists characters (A-E).
- int[] weights consists weights of characters A-E in the order A-E.

Your task is to return the total weight of string s according to weights given.

Example :

`totalWeight("EEDBCCAB", [4, 3, 2, 1, 5]) = 25`

`{ (1A = 4) + (2B = 6) + (2C = 4) + (1D = 1) + (2E = 10) = 25 }`

## [](https://github.com/LavishSwarnkar/NAAD2/tree/master/src/com/streamliners/task1#13-isdirectlyproportional)1.3 isDirectlyProportional()

Write a function `boolean isDirectlyProportional(int[] x, int[] y)`where :

- x & y are two inter-related mathematical variables
- x.length = y.length
- x[i] is related to y[i]

Your task is to return a boolean stating whether x & y are directly proportional to each other.

## [](https://github.com/LavishSwarnkar/NAAD2/tree/master/src/com/streamliners/task1#14-custom-exception--regexp)1.4 Custom exception & RegExp

Learn about Custom exceptions [here](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples/create-custom-exception)

Your task is to throw custom exception named InvalidReplacementsException in Task 1.1's program when

- replacements string is invalid

- replacement for a digit in s is not given in replacements string

Example :

- modify("12", "2R") is invalid as replacement for 1 is not given

- modify("12", "12") is invalid as it does not match the format < int, char >

**To check validity of replacement string, use Regular Expressions.**
